## Technologies

The Recipe Exchange is built using various technologies:

- Django: A Python web framework for building web applications.
- Bootstrap: A front-end framework for responsive and visually appealing design.
- PostgreSQL: An open-source relational database for data storage.
- Cloudinary: Cloud-based image storage for recipe images.
- Heroku: The platform where the project is deployed.
- Git and GitHub: Version control and code repository management.
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

## Deployment

The project is deployed on Heroku, a cloud platform for hosting web applications. It can be accessed online at [Heroku Recipe Exchange](https://myurl.com)

I have done the following:
1. Created a Heroku account and install the Heroku CLI.
2. Set up a new Heroku app and connect it to my project's Git repository.
3. Configure environment variables for settings like database connection and secret keys.
4. Deployed my project to Heroku manually by logging in and connecting it to the GitHub repository directly on the site.
5. Migrate your database and run any necessary setup tasks.
6. Opened up my app on Heroku.
